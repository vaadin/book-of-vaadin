msgid "Vaadin provides two development models for web applications: for the client-side (the browser) and for the server-side. The server-driven development model is the more powerful one, allowing application development solely on the server-side, by utilizing an AJAX-based Vaadin Client-Side Engine that renders the user interface in the browser. The client-side model allows developing widgets and applications in Java, which are compiled to JavaScript and executed in the browser. The two models can share their UI widgets, themes, and back-end code and services, and can be mixed together easily."

This way, only small parts of the page data need to be loaded. This goal is archieved by the use of a certain set of technologies: XHTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and the XMLHttpRequest API in JavaScript.
