        <title>Overview</title>
        
        <para>
            Testing is one of the cornerstones of modern software development. Extending
            throughout the development process, testing is the thread that binds the
            product to the requirements. In agile and other iterative development
            processes, with ever shorter release cycles and continuous integration, the
            automation of integration, regression, endurance, and acceptance testing is
            paramount. Further, UI automation may be needed for integration purposes, such
            as for assistive technologies. The special nature of web applications creates
            many unique requirements for both testing and UI automation.
        </para>

        <para>
            Vaadin TestBench allows controlling the browser from Java code, as illustrated
            in <xref linkend="figure.testbench.webdriver"/>. It can open a new browser
            window to start the application, interact with the UI components, for example,
            by clicking them, and then get the HTML element values.

        <para>
            Before going into details, you may want to try out Vaadin TestBench
            yourself. You just need to create a new Vaadin project either with the Eclipse
            plugin or the Maven archetype. Both create a simple application stub that
            includes TestBench test cases for testing the UI. You also need to install an
            evaluation license. For instructions, jump to <xref
            linkend="testbench.quickstart"/> and, after trying it out, come back.

            <title>Vaadin TestBench in Software Development</title>

            <para>
                Vaadin TestBench can work as the centerpiece of the software development
                process, for testing the application at all modular levels and in all the
                phases of the development cycle:
            </para>

                <listitem><para>Regression tests</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>
                Let us look at each of these topics separately.
            </para>

            <para>
                Any methodological software development, agile or not, is preceded by
                specification of requirements, which define what the software should
                actually do. <emphasis>Acceptance tests</emphasis> ensure that the product
                conforms to the requirements. In agile development, their automation
                allows continuous tracking of progress towards iteration goals, as well as
                detecting regressions. The importance of requirements is emphasized in
                <emphasis>test-driven development</emphasis> (TDD), where tests are
                written before actual code. In <xref linkend="testbench.bdd"/>, we show
                how to use Vaadin TestBench for <emphasis>behaviour-driven
                development</emphasis> (BDD), a form of TDD that concentrates on the
                formal behavioural specification of requirements.
            </para>

            <para>
                <emphasis>Unit testing</emphasis> is applied to the smallest scale of
                software components; in Vaadin applications these are typically individual
                UI components or view classes. For complex composites, such as views, you
                can use the Page Object Pattern described in <xref
                linkend="testbench.maintainable.pageobject"/>. The pattern simplifies and
                modularizes testing by separating low-level details from the more abstract
                UI logic. In addition to serving the purpose of unit tests, it creates an
                abstraction layer for higher-level tests, such as acceptance and
                end-to-end tests.
            </para>

            <para>
                <emphasis>Integration tests</emphasis> ensure that software units work
                together at different levels of modularization. At the broadest level,
                <emphasis>end-to-end tests</emphasis> extend through the entire
                application lifecycle from start to finish, going through many or all user
                stories. The aim is not just to verify the functional requirements for
                user interaction, but also that data integrity is maintained. For example,
                in a messaging application, a user would log in, both send and receive
                messages, and finally log out. Such test workflows could include
                configuration, registration, interaction between users, administrative
                tasks, deletion of user accounts, and so forth.
            </para>

            <para>
                In regression testing, you want to ensure that only intended changes occur
                in its behaviour after modifying the code, without testing the application
                manually every time. There are two basic ways of detecting such
                regressions. Screenshots are the strictest way, but usually checking the
                displayed values in the HTML is better if you are more interested in the
                content and want to allow some flexibility for themeing, for example. You
                may also want to generate many different kinds of inputs to the
                application and check that they produce the desired outputs.
            </para>

            <para>
                You can develop such tests along with your application code, for example
                with JUnit, which is a widely used Java unit testing framework. You can
                run the tests as many times as you want in your workstation or in a
                distributed grid setup.

            <para>
                Execution of tests can be distributed over a grid of test nodes, which
                speeds up testing. The grid nodes can run different operating systems and
                have different browsers installed. In a minimal setup, such as for
                developing the tests, you can use Vaadin TestBench on just a single
                computer.

                Continuous integration means automatic compilation and testing of
                applications frequently, typically at least daily, but ideally every time
                when code changes are committed to the source repository. This practice
                allows catching integration problems early and finding the changes that
                first caused them to occur.

                You can make unit tests with Vaadin TestBench just like you would do any
                other Java unit tests, so they work seamlessly with continuous integration
                systems. Vaadin TestBench is tested to work with at least TeamCity and
                Hudson/Jenkins build management and continuous integration servers, which

                The grid hub is a service that handles communication between the JUnit
                test runner and the nodes. The nodes are services that perform the actual
                execution of test commands in the browser.
            </para>

            <para>
                The hub requires very little resources, so you would typically run it
                either in the test server or on one of the nodes. You can run the tests,
                the hub, and one node all in one host, but in a fully distributed setup,
                you install the Vaadin TestBench components on separate hosts.

            <para>
                Controlling browsers over a distributed setup requires using a remote

        <title>Developing JUnit Tests</title>

        <para>
            JUnit is a popular unit testing framework for Java development. Most Java
            IDEs, build systems, and continuous integration systems provide support for
            JUnit. However, while we concentrate on the development of JUnit tests in this
            chapter, Vaadin TestBench and the WebDriver are in no way specific to JUnit
            and you can use any test execution framework, or just regular Java
            applications, to develop TestBench tests.
        </para>

        <para>
            You may want to keep your test classes in a separate source tree in your
            application project, or in an altogether separate project, so that you do not
            have to include them in the web application WAR. Having them in the same
            project may be nicer for version control purposes.

            <title>Basic Test Case Structure</title>

            <para>
                A JUnit test case is defined with annotations for methods in a test case
                class. With TestBench, the test case class should extend the
                <classname>TestBenchTestCase</classname> class, which provides the
                WebDriver and ElementQuery APIs.

                            The annotated method is executed before each test (annotated
                            with <literal>@Test</literal>). Normally, you create and set
                            the driver here.

                            The driver class should be one of
                            <classname>FirefoxDriver</classname>,
                            <classname>ChromeDriver</classname>,

                            directly by the member variable, you should set it only with
                            the setter.

                            driver in that case. The rule quits the driver implicitly.

            <para>
                Vaadin TestBench uses Selenium WebDriver to execute tests in a
                browser. The <classname>WebDriver</classname> instance is created with the
                static <methodname>createDriver()</methodname> method in the
                <classname>TestBench</classname> class. It takes the driver as the
                parameter and returns it after registering it. The test cases must extend
                the <classname>TestBenchTestCase</classname> class, which manages the
                TestBench-specific features. You need to store the driver in the test case
                with <methodname>setDriver()</methodname>.
            </para>

            <para>
                The basic way is to create the driver in a method annotated with the
                JUnit <literal>@Before</literal> annotation and close it in a method
                annotated with <literal>@After</literal>.

                This creates the driver for each test you have in the test class, causing

                browser open between the tests, you can use
                <literal>@BeforeClass</literal> and <literal>@AfterClass</literal> methods
                to create and quit the driver. In that case, the methods as well as the
                driver instance have to be static and you need to set the driver in a
                <literal>@Before</literal> method.

            The high-level ElementQuery API allows querying Vaadin components in the

            properties. Once one or more components are found, they can be interacted
            upon. The query API forms an domain-specific language (DSL), embedded in the

            The basic idea of element queries match elements and return queries, which can

            its corresponding element class, which has methods to interact with the

                like before generating the query code, but we recommend that you proceed
                by following the sequence in which the user would use the UI in each use
                case, making the queries at each step.

                elements, it highlights them, and when you click one, it generates the

                distributed in a Vaadin library rather than with TestBench, as they must
                correspond with the Vaadin version used in the application.

                In addition to components, other Vaadin UI elements such as notifications
                (see <xref linkend="testbench.special.notifications"/>) can have their
                corresponding element class. Add-on libraries may also define their custom

                element. For example, in the following we first find a layout element by
                its ID and then do a sub-query to find the first label in it:

        <para>
            In addition to the high-level ElementQuery API described in the previous
            section, Vaadin TestBench includes the lower-level Selenium WebDriver API,
            with Vaadin extensions. You can find elements also by a plain XPath
            expression, an element ID, CSS style class, and so on. You can use such
            selectors together with the element queries. Like the ElementQuery API, it can
            be considered a domain-specific language (DSL) that is embedded in the
            <classname>TestBenchTestCase</classname> class.
        </para>

        <para>
            The available selectors are defined as static methods in the
            <classname>com.vaadin.testbench.By</classname> class. They create and return a
            <classname>By</classname> instance, which you can use for the
            <methodname>findElement()</methodname> method in
            <classname>WebDriver</classname>.

        <para>
            Some selectors are not applicable to all elements, for example if an element
            does not have an ID or it is outside the Vaadin application. In such case,
            another selector is used according to a preference order. You can change the
            order of the preferred selectors by selecting
            <menuchoice><guimenu>Options</guimenu><guisubmenu>Options</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Locator
            Builders</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and dragging the selectors (or locators)
            to a preferred order. Normally, the Vaadin selector should be at top of the
            list.

                example, as they are floating <literal>div</literal> elements under the
                root element of the application. Their <literal>v-tooltip</literal> style

            In the following, we go through a number of TestBench features for handling
            special cases, such as tooltips, scrolling, notifications, context menus, and

            <title>Waiting for Vaadin</title>

            <para>
                Selenium, on which Vaadin TestBench is based, is originally intended for
                regular web applications that load a page that is immediately rendered by
                the browser. In such applications, you can test the page elements
                immediately after the page is loaded. In Vaadin and other AJAX
                applications, rendering is done by JavaScript code asynchronously, so you
                need to wait until the server has given its response to an AJAX request
                and the JavaScript code finishes rendering the UI. Selenium supports AJAX
                applications by having special wait methods to poll the UI until the
                rendering is finished. In pure Selenium, you need to use the wait methods
                explicitly, and know what to use and when. Vaadin TestBench works together
                with the client-side engine of Vaadin framework to immediately detect when
                the rendering is finished. Waiting is implicit, so you do not normally
                need to insert any wait commands yourself.
            </para>

            <para>
                Waiting is automatically enabled, but it may be necessary to disable it in
                some cases. You can do that by calling
                <methodname>disableWaitForVaadin()</methodname> in the
                <interfacename>TestBenchCommands</interfacename> interface. You can call

            <para>

                Component tooltips show when you hover the mouse over a component. Showing

                Some Vaadin components, such as <classname>Table</classname> and

                to scroll to the element to make it visible. In some cases, you may wish
                to scroll a scrollbar explicitly. You can accomplish that with the

                A context menu is displayed as a floating element, which is under a
                special overlays element in the HTML page, not under the component from
                which it pops up. You can find it from the page by its CSS class
                <literal>v-contextmenu</literal>. The menu items are represented as text,

                execution times consistently is not trivial, as a test environment can
                have different kinds of latency and interference. For example in a
                distributed setup, timings taken on the test server would include the
                latencies between the test server, the grid hub, a grid node running the
                browser, and the web server running the application. In such a setup, you
                could also expect interference between multiple test nodes, which all
                might make requests to a shared application server and possibly also share
                virtual machine resources.

                Furthermore, in Vaadin applications, there are two sides which need to be
                profiled: the server-side, on which the application logic is executed, and
                the client-side, where it is rendered in the browser. Vaadin TestBench
                includes methods for measuring execution time both on the server-side and
                the client-side.

                            application on the server-side. The timer starts when you
                            first navigate to the application and hence start a new
                            session. The time passes only when servicing requests for the
                            particular session.  The timer is shared in the servlet
                            session, so if you have, for example, multiple portlets in the
                            same application (session), their execution times will be
                            included in the same total.

        <title>Creating Maintainable Tests</title>

        <para>
            The first important rule in developing tests is to keep them readable and
            maintainable. Otherwise, when the test fail, such as after refactoring the
            application code, the developers get impatient in trying to understand them to
            fix them, and easily disable them. Readability and maintainability can be
            improved with the Page Object Pattern described below.
        </para>

        <para>
            The second rule is to run the tests often. It is best to use a continuous
            integration server to run them at least once a day, or preferably on every
            commit.

            <title>Increasing Selector Robustness</title>

            <para>
                Robustness of tests is important for avoiding failures because of
                irrelevant changes in the HTML DOM tree.  Different selectors have
                differences in their robustness and it depends on how they are used.
            </para>

            <para>
                The ElementQuery API uses the logical widget hierarchy to find the HTML
                elements, instead of the exact HTML DOM structure. This makes them
                somewhat robust, although still vulnerable to irrelevant changes in the
                exact component hierarchy of the UI. Also, if you internationalize the
                application, selecting components by their caption is not viable.
            </para>

            <para>
                The low-level XPath selector can be highly vulnerable to changes in the
                DOM path, especially if the path is given down from the body element of
                the page. The selector is, however, very flexible, and can be used in
                robust ways, for example, by selecting by HTML element and a CSS class
                name or an attribute value. You can likewise use a CSS selector to select
                specific components by CSS class in a robust way.

                    To make UIs more robust for testing, you can set a unique

                    Let us consider the following application, in which we set the IDs

                    Screenshots cover the visible page area in the browser. The size of
                    the browser is therefore relevant for screenshot comparison. The
                    browser is normally sized with a predefined default size. You can set
                    the size of the browser window in a couple of ways. You can set the
                    size of the browser window with, for example,
                    <literal>driver.manage().window().setSize(new Dimension(1024,
                    768));</literal> in the <literal>@Before</literal> method. The size
                    includes any browser chrome, so the actual screenshot size will be
                    smaller. To set the actual view area, you can use
                    <literal>TestBenchCommands.resizeViewPortTo(1024, 768)</literal>.

                    a string literal quoted with double quotes
                    (<literal>"key"</literal>). The value can be a string literal, list,

        <title>Headless Testing</title>
        
        <para>
            TestBench (3.1 and later) supports fully-featured headless testing with
            PhantomJS (<link
            xlink:href="http://phantomjs.org">http://phantomjs.org</link>), a headless
            browser based on WebKit. It has fast native support for various web standards:
            JavaScript, DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas, and SVG.
        </para>

        <para>
            Headless testing using PhantomJS allows for around 15% faster test execution
            without having to start a graphical web browser, even when performing
            screenshot-based testing! This also makes it possible to run full-scale
            functional tests on the front-end directly on a build server, without the need
            to install any web browsers.
        </para>

        <para>
            It is usually best to use a graphical browser to develop the test cases, as it
            is possible to see interactively what happens while the tests are being
            executed.  Once the tests are working correctly in a graphical browser, you
            can migrate them to run on the PhantomJS headless browser.

                    Some tests may fail because of the small default window size in
                    PhantomJS. Such tests are, for example, tests containing elements that
                    pop up and might go off-screen when the window is small. To make them
                    work better, specify a size for the window:

        <title>Behaviour-Driven Development</title>

        <para>
            Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is a development methodology based on
            test-driven development, where development starts from writing tests for the
            software-to-be. BDD involves using a <emphasis>ubiquitous language</emphasis>
            to communicate between business goals - the desired behaviour - and tests to
            ensure that the software fulfills those goals.
        </para>

        <para>
            The BDD process starts by collection of business requirements expressed as
            <emphasis>user stories</emphasis>, as is typical in agile methodologies. A
            user with a <emphasis>role</emphasis> requests a <emphasis>feature</emphasis>
            to gain a <emphasis>benefit</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Stories can be expressed as number of <emphasis>scenarios</emphasis> that
            describe different cases of the desired behaviour. Such a scenario can be
            formalized with the following three phases:
        </para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Given</emphasis> that I have calculator open</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>When</emphasis> I push calculator buttons</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Then</emphasis> the display should show the result</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>
            This kind of formalization is realized in the JBehave BDD framework for Java.
            The TestBench Demo includes a JBehave example, where the above scenario is
            written as the <link

        </para>

        <para>
            Such scenarios are included in one or more stories, which need to be
            configured in a class extending <classname>JUnitStory</classname> or
            <classname>JUnitStories</classname>. In the example, this is done in the <link

        <para>
            This section provides information and instructions on a few features that are known
            to be difficult to use or need modification to work.

            <title>Running Firefox Tests on Mac OS X</title>

            <para>
                Firefox needs to have focus in the main window for any focus events to be
                triggered. This sometimes causes problems if something interferes with the
                focus. For example, a <classname>TextField</classname> that has an input
                prompt relies on the JavaScript <methodname>onFocus()</methodname> event
                to clear the prompt when the field is focused.
            </para>

            <para>
                The problem occurs when OS X considers the Java process of an application
                using TestBench (or the node service) to have a native user interface
                capability, as with AWT or Swing, even when they are not used. This causes
                the focus to switch from Firefox to the process using TestBench, causing
                tests requiring focus to fail. To remedy this problem, you need to start
                the JVM in which the tests are running with the
                <parameter>-Djava.awt.headless=true</parameter> parameter to disable the
                user interface capability of the Java process.
            </para>

            <para>
                Note that the same problem is present also when debugging tests with
                Firefox. We therefore recommend using Chrome for debugging tests, unless
                Firefox is necessary.
