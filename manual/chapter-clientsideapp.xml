	<title>Client-Side Applications</title>

    <para>
        This chapter describes how to develop client-side Vaadin applications.
    </para>

    <para>
        <emphasis>We only give a brief introduction to the topic in this book. Please
        refer to the GWT documentation for a more complete treatment of the many GWT
        features. </emphasis>

        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>
            Vaadin allows developing client-side modules that run in the browser.
            Client-side modules can use all the GWT widgets and some Vaadin-specific
            widgets, as well as the same themes as server-side Vaadin
            applications. Client-side applications run in the browser, even with no
            further server communications. When paired with a server-side service to gain
            access to data storage and server-side business logic, client-side
            applications can be considered "fat clients", in comparison to the "thin
            client" approach of the server-side Vaadin applications. The services can use
            the same back-end services as server-side Vaadin applications. Fat clients are
            useful for a range of purposes when you have a need for highly responsive UI
            logic, such as for games or for serving a huge number of clients with possibly
            stateless server-side code.

        <para>
            A client-side application is defined as a <emphasis>module</emphasis>, which
            has an <emphasis>entry-point</emphasis> class. Its
            <methodname>onModuleLoad()</methodname> method is executed when the JavaScript
            of the compiled module is loaded in the browser.
        </para>

        <para>
            Consider the following client-side application:
        </para>

        <programlisting><?pocket-size 75% ?><![CDATA[public class HelloWorld implements EntryPoint {
    @Override
    public void onModuleLoad() {
        RootPanel.get().add(new Label("Hello, world!"));
    }
}]]></programlisting>

        <para>
           The user interface of a client-side application is built under a HTML
           <emphasis>root element</emphasis>, which can be accessed by
           <methodname>RootPanel.get()</methodname>. The purpose and use of the
           entry-point is documented in more detail in <xref
           linkend="clientsideapp.entrypoint"/>. The user interface is built from
           <emphasis>widgets</emphasis> hierarchically, just like with server-side Vaadin
           UIs. The built-in widgets and their relationships are catalogued in <xref
           linkend="clientsidewidgets"/>. You can also use many of the widgets in Vaadin add-ons
           that have them, or make your own.
        </para>

        <para>
            A client-side module is defined in a <emphasis>module descriptor</emphasis>,
            as described in <xref linkend="clientside.module"/>. A module is
            compiled from Java to JavaScript using the Vaadin Compiler, of which use was
            described in <xref linkend="clientside.compiling"/>. The <xref
            linkend="clientsideapp.compiling"/> in this chapter gives further information
            about compiling client-side applications. The resulting JavaScript can be
            loaded to any web page, as described in <xref
            linkend="clientsideapp.loading"/>.
        </para>

        <para>
            The client-side user interface can be built declaratively using the included
            <emphasis>UI Binder</emphasis><!--, as described in <xref
            linkend="clientsideapp.uibinder"/> -->.
        </para>

        <para>
            The servlet for processing RPC calls from the client-side can be generated
            automatically using the included compiler.
        </para>

        <para>
            Even with regular server-side Vaadin applications, it may be useful to provide
            an off-line mode if the connection is closed. An off-line mode can persist
            data in a local store in the browser, thereby avoiding the need for
            server-side storage, and transmit the data to the server when the connection
            is again available. Such a pattern is commonly used with Vaadin TouchKit.<!-- Use
            of a client-side application to provide an off-line mode is described in <xref
            linkend="clientsideapp.offline"/>.-->
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="clientsideapp.entrypoint">
        <title>Client-Side Module Entry-Point</title>

        <para>
            A client-side application requires an <emphasis>entry-point</emphasis> where
            the execution starts, much like the <methodname>init()</methodname> method in
            server-side Vaadin UIs.
        </para>

        <para>
            Consider the following application:
        </para>

        <programlisting><?pocket-size 65% ?><![CDATA[package com.example.myapp.client;

import com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint;
import com.google.gwt.event.dom.client.ClickEvent;
import com.google.gwt.event.dom.client.ClickHandler;
import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.RootPanel;
import com.vaadin.ui.VButton;

public class MyEntryPoint implements EntryPoint {
    @Override
    public void onModuleLoad() {
        // Create a button widget
        Button button = new Button();
        button.setText("Click me!");
        button.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
                mywidget.setText("Hello, world!");
            }
        });
        RootPanel.get().add(button);
    }
}]]></programlisting>
            
        <para>
            Before compiling, the entry-point needs to be defined in a module
            descriptor, as described in the next section.
        </para>

        <section xml:id="clientsideapp.entrypoint.descriptor">
            <title>Module Descriptor</title>

            <para>
                The entry-point of a client-side application is defined, along with any
                other configuration, in a client-side module descriptor, described in
                <xref linkend="clientside.module"/>. The descriptor is an XML file
                with suffix <filename>.gwt.xml</filename>.
            </para>

                You might rather want to inherit the
                <classname>com.google.gwt.user.User</classname> to get just the basic GWT
                widgets, and not the Vaadin-specific widgets and classes, most of which
                are unusable in pure client-side applications.
            </para>

            <para>
                You can put static resources, such as images or CSS stylesheets, in a
                <filename>public</filename> folder (not a Java package) under the folder
                of the descriptor file. When the module is compiled, the resources are
                copied to the output folder. Normally in pure client-side application
                development, it is easier to load them in the HTML host file or in a
                <classname>ClientBundle</classname> (see GWT documentation), but these
                methods are not compatible with server-side component integration, if you
                use the resources for that purpose as well.

        <para>
            The application needs to be compiled into JavaScript to run it in a

            the Development Mode, you need to do the compilation with the Vaadin Client
            Compiler, as described in <xref linkend="clientside.compiling"/>.

            During development, it is easiest to use the SuperDevMode, which also quickly
            launching the client-side code and also allows debugging. See <xref

        <para>
            You can load the JavaScript code of a client-side application in an HTML
            <emphasis>host page</emphasis> by including it with a
            <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal> tag, for example as follows:

        <para>
            The JavaScript module is loaded in a <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal>
            element. The <literal>src</literal> parameter should be a relative
            link from the host page to the compiled JavaScript module.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            If the application uses any supplementary Vaadin widgets, and not just
            core GWT widgets, you need to include the Vaadin theme as was done in the
            example. The exact path to the style file depends on your project
            structure - the example is given for a regular Vaadin application where
            themes are contained in the <filename>VAADIN</filename> folder in the WAR.
        </para>

        <para>
            In addition to CSS and scripts, you can load any other resources needed by the
            client-side application in the host page.
