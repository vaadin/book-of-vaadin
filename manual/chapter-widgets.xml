    <para>
        This chapter gives basic documentation on the use of the Vaadin client-side
        framework for the purposes of creating client-side applications and writing your
        own widgets.

        <emphasis>This edition is a draft. Many new features that will be included in
        Vaadin 7 are not yet covered in the draft and some of the content may in fact be
        outdated. For the most current version, please see the on-line edition available

        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>
            The Vaadin client-side API is based on the Google Web Toolkit. It involves
            <emphasis>widgets</emphasis> for representing the user interface as Java
            objects, which are rendered as a HTML DOM in the browser. Events caused by
            user interaction with the page are delegated to event handlers, where you can
            implement your UI logic. 
        </para>

        <para>
            In general, the client-side widgets come in two categories - basic GWT widgets
            and Vaadin-specific widgets. The library includes
            <emphasis>connectors</emphasis> for integrating the Vaadin-specific widgets
            with the server-side components, thereby enabling the server-side development
            model of Vaadin. The integration is described in <xref linkend="gwt"/>.
        </para>

        <para>
            The layout of the client-side UI is managed with <emphasis>panel</emphasis>
            widgets, which correspond in their function with layout components in the
            Vaadin server-side API.
        </para>

        <para>
            In addition to the rendering API, the client-side API includes facilities for
            making HTTP requests, logging, accessibility, internationalization, and
            testing.

        <title>GWT Widgets</title>

        <para>
            GWT widgets are user interface elements that are rendered as HTML. Rendering
            is done by manipulating the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) through the
            lower-level DOM API. The layout of the user interface is managed using special
            panel widgets.
        </para>

        <title>Vaadin Widgets</title>

        <para>
            Vaadin comes with a number of Vaadin-specific widgets in addition to the GWT
            widgets. The Vaadin widgets have somewhat different feature set from the GWT
            widgets and are foremost intended for integration with the server-side
            components.
