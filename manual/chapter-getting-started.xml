	<title>Getting Started with Vaadin</title>

	<para>
		This chapter gives practical instructions for installing the recommended
		toolchain, the Vaadin libraries and its dependencies, and creating a new Vaadin
		project.
	</para>

		<title>Overview</title>

        <para>
            You can develop Vaadin applications in essentially any development environment
            that has the Java SDK and a Java Servlet container. Vaadin has special support
            for the Eclipse IDE, but community support exists also for the NetBeans IDE
            and IntelliJ IDEA, and you can use it with any Java IDE or no IDE at all.
        </para>

        <para>
            Managing Vaadin and other Java libraries can get tedious to do manually, so
            using a build system that manages dependencies automatically is
            adviced. Vaadin is distributed in the Maven central repository, and can be
            used with any build or dependency management system that can access Maven
            repository, such as Ivy or Gradle, in addition to Maven.
        </para>

        <para>
            Vaadin has a multitude of installation options for different IDEs, dependency
            managers, and you can also install it from an installation package:

		<title>Setting up the Development Environment</title>
		
		<para>
			This section guides you step-by-step in setting up a reference development
			environment. Vaadin supports a wide variety of tools, so you can use any IDE
			for writing the code, almost any Java web server for deploying the
			application, most web browsers for using it, and any operating system platform
			supported by Java.
		</para>

		<para>
			In this example, we use the following toolchain:
        </para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X</listitem>
            <listitem><link xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition 6.0</link> (JDK 1.6 or newer is required)</listitem>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>
			The above reference toolchain is a good choice of tools, but you can use
			almost any tools you are comfortable with. 
		</para>

        <para>
            We recommend using Java 8 for Vaadin development, but you need to make sure
            that your entire toolchain supports it. If you intend to use server push, you
            need to use at least Java EE 7 compatible server with WebSocket support, such
            as Glassfish, TomEE, etc.

		<para>
			<xref linkend="figure.toolchain"/> illustrates the development toolchain. You
			develop your application as an Eclipse project. The project must include, in
			addition to your source code, the Vaadin libraries. It can also include
			project-specific themes.
		</para>

		<para>
			You need to compile and deploy a project to a web container before you can use
			it. You can deploy a project through the Web Tools Platform (WTP) for Eclipse
			(included in the Eclipse EE package), which allows automatic deployment of web
			applications from Eclipse. You can also deploy a project manually, by creating
			a web application archive (WAR) and deploying it to the web container.

			<title>Installing Java SDK</title>

			<para>
				Java SDK is required by Vaadin and also by the Eclipse IDE.  Vaadin is
				compatible with Java 1.6 and later editions. Java EE 7 is required for
				proper server push support with WebSockets.

                    Most Linux systems either have JDK preinstalled or allow installing it
                    through a package management system. Notice however that they have
                    OpenJDK as the default Java implementation. While it is known to have
                    worked with Vaadin and possibly also with the development toolchain,
                    we do not especially support it.

                            <literal>PATH</literal>. How you do that varies by the UNIX
                            variant. For example, in Linux and using the Bash shell, you
                            would add lines such as the following to the
                            <filename>.bashrc</filename> or <filename>.profile</filename>
                            script in your home directory:

export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin</screen>

                            You could also make the setting system-wide in a file such as
                            <filename>/etc/bash.bashrc</filename>,
                            <filename>/etc/profile</filename>, or an equivalent file. If
                            you install Apache Ant or Maven, you may also want to set up
                            those in the path.

                            Settings done in a <filename>bashrc</filename> file require
                            that you open a new shell window. Settings done in a
                            <filename>profile</filename> file require that you log in into
                            the system. You can, of course, also give the commands in the
                            current shell.

                            Eclipse should normally be installed as a regular user, as
                            this makes installation of plugins easier. Eclipse also stores
                            some user settings in the installation directory. To install
                            the package, enter:

                            This will extract the package to a subdirectory with the name

                        The Vaadin Client Compiler is a Java-to-JavaScript compiler
                        that allows building client-side modules, such as the
                        Client-Side Engine (widget set) required for server-side
                        applications. The compiler is needed, for example, for
                        compiling add-on components to the application widget set, as
                        described in <xref linkend="addons"/>. <!-- TODO There's a need for such section. -->

                Updating the Vaadin plugin does not update Vaadin libraries. The libraries
                are project specific, as a different version might be required for
                different projects, so you have to update them separately for each
                project.

            Maven is a commonly used build and dependency management system.

            The Vaadin core library and all Vaadin add-ons are available through
            Maven. You can use a Maven with a front-end from Eclipse or NetBeans, or by
            using the command-line as described in this section.
        </para>

        <para>
            In addition to regular Maven, you can use any Maven-compatible build or
            dependency management system, such as Ivy or Gradle. For Gradle, see the <link
            xlink:href="https://github.com/johndevs/gradle-vaadin-plugin">Gradle Vaadin
            Plugin</link>. Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse uses Ivy for resolving dependencies
            in Vaadin projects, and it should provide you with the basic Ivy
            configuration.

		<title>Creating a Project with NetBeans IDE</title>

        <para>
            The easiest way to develop Vaadin application with the NetBeans IDE is to use
            the Vaadin Plugin for NetBeans. It allows you to create new Vaadin projects
            easily and provides many features for working on a project. You can download
            the plugin at <link
            xlink:href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/50531/vaadin-plug-in-for-netbeans">http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/50531/vaadin-plug-in-for-netbeans</link>. The

        <para>
            Without the plugin, you can most easily create a Vaadin project as a Maven
            project using a Vaadin archetype. You can also create a Vaadin project as a
            regular web application project, but it requires many manual steps to install
            all the Vaadin libraries, create the UI class, configure the servlet, create
            theme, and so on.

                    will also compile the widget set and theme, if necessary. See <xref

            You can use Vaadin with any JVM compatible language, such as Scala or
            Groovy. There are, however, some caveats related to libraries and project
            set-up. In the following, we give instructions for creating a Scala UI in
            Eclipse, with the Scala IDE for Eclipse and the Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse.

                    The web application needs <filename>scala-library.jar</filename> in
                    its class path. If using Scala IDE, you can copy it from somewhere
                    under your Eclipse installation to the class path of the web
                    application, that is, either to the
                    <filename>WebContent/WEB-INF/lib</filename> folder in the project or
                    to the library path of the application server. If copying outside
                    Eclipse to a project, refresh the project by selecting it and pressing
                    <keycap>F5</keycap>.

                <para>
                    You could also get it with an Ivy or Maven dependency, just make sure
                    that the version is same as what the Scala IDE uses.

            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>
            You should now be able to create a Scala UI class, such as the following:

        <para>

        </para>

        <para>
            You need to define the Scala UI class either in a servlet class (in Servlet

            like described in <xref linkend="getting-started.first-project.exploring"/>
            for Java UIs.
