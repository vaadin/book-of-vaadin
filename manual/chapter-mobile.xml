        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>
            Web browsing is becoming ever increasingly mobile and web applications need to
            satisfy users with both desktop computers and mobile devices, such as phones
            and tablets. While the mobile browsers can show the pages just like in regular
            browsers, the screen size, finger accuracy, and mobile browser features need
            to be considered to make the experience more pleasant. Vaadin TouchKit gives
            the power of Vaadin for creating mobile user interfaces that complement the
            regular web user interfaces of your applications. Just like the purpose of the
            Vaadin Framework is to make desktop-like web applications, the purpose of
            TouchKit is to allow creation of web applications that give the look and feel
            of native mobile applications.

            Creating a mobile UI is much like creating a regular Vaadin UI. You can use
            all the regular Vaadin components and add-ons available from Vaadin Directory,
            but most importantly, you can use the special TouchKit components that are
            optimized for mobile devices.

            TouchKit supports many special mobile browser features, such as geolocation,
            context-specific input fields, and home screen launching. On iOS, special
            features such as splash screen and web app mode are supported.

        <para>
            In addition to developing regular server-side UIs, TouchKit allows a special
            <emphasis>offline mode</emphasis>, which is a client-side Vaadin UI that is
            stored in the browser cache and switched to automatically when the network
            connection is not available, either when starting the application or while
            using it. For more information, see <xref linkend="mobile.offline"/>.

        <para>
            In this chapter, we first consider some special aspects of mobile
            browsing. Then, we look how to create a project that uses TouchKit. TouchKit
            offers a number of specialized mobile components, which are described in a
            dedicated section. We treat phone and tablet applications separately, and
            discuss testing briefly.

								The Parking demo showcases the most important TouchKit features for a mobile

            <para>
                Vaadin TouchKit is a commercial product licensed under a dual-licensing
                scheme. The AGPL license allows open-source development, while the CVAL
                license needs to be purchased for closed-source use, including web
                deployments and internal use. Commercial licenses can be purchased from
                Vaadin Directory, where you can also find the license details and
                download Vaadin TouchKit.

    <section xml:id="mobile.considerations">
        <title>Considerations Regarding Mobile Browsing</title>

        <para>
            When developing web applications that support mobile browsing, you need to
            consider various issues that are different from non-mobile use. TouchKit is
            designed to help with these issues.
        </para>

        <section xml:id="mobile.considerations.mobile-hi">
            <title>Mobile Human Interface</title>

            <para>
                Mobile devices use very different human interfaces than regular
                computers. For example, the screen can be rotated easily to switch between
                portrait and landscape views. This does not just change the dimensions of
                the display, but also affects how to arrange components for the best user
								experience. In addition to TouchKit, responsive layouts help in allowing
								flexible layouts, as described in <xref linkend="themes.responsive"/>.
            </para>

            <para>
                The user interface is used with a finger instead of a mouse, so there are
                no features such as "right-finger-button". When using a mouse you can click
								double-click or right-click, but on a touch device, you are using
								interactions such as tap and "long tap". Finger gestures also play a large
								role, such as using a vertical swipe gesture for scrolling instead of a
								scroll bar. Some browsers also allow using two- or multiple-finger gestures.
            </para>

            <para>
                There is normally no physical keyboard, but an on-screen keyboard, which
								can change depending on the context. You also need to ensure that it does
								not hide the input field to which the user is trying to enter data when it
                pops up. This should be handled by the browser, but is among the issues
                that requires special testing.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="mobile.considerations.bandwidth">
            <title>Bandwidth and Performance</title>

            <para>
                Mobile Internet connections are often significantly slower than with fixed
                lines. With a low-end mobile connection, such as 384 kbps, just loading
                the Vaadin client-side engine can take several seconds. This can be helped
                by compiling a widget set that includes only the widgets for the used
                components, as described in <xref linkend="mobile.optimization"/>, by
                compiling the theme into the widget set, and so forth.
            </para>

            <para>
                Even with mobile broadband, the latency can be significant factor,
                especially with highly interactive rich applications. The latency is
                usually almost unnoticeable in fixed lines, typically less than 100 ms,
                while mobile Edge connections typically have latency around 500 ms, and
                sometimes much higher during hiccups. You may need to limit the use of the
                immediate mode, text change events, and polling. The latency compensation
                in some components, such as <classname>NavigationManager</classname>,
                allows view change animations to occur while the server request to display
                the result is being made.
            </para>

            <para>
                Further, the choice of components affects performance. TouchKit components
                are designed to be light-weight. Of the other Vaadin components, some are
                more light-weight than others. Especially, most other layout components
                have a more deeper DOM structure and are slower to render than the
                light-weight <classname>CssLayout</classname>. TouchKit also includes
                special styling for <classname>CssLayout</classname>.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="mobile.considerations.features">
            <title>Mobile Features</title>

            <para>
                Phones and tablets have many integrated features that are often available in
                the browser interface as well. Location-awareness is one of the most recent
                features. And of course, you can also make phone calls.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="mobile.considerations.compatibility">
            <title>Compatibility</title>

            <para>
                The mobile browsing field is currently evolving at a quick pace and the
                special conventions introduced by leading manufacturers may, in the next
								few years, stabilize as new web standards. The browser support in
                TouchKit originally concentrated on WebKit, which appears to be emerging
								as the leading mobile browser core. In addition to Apple's products, also
								the default browser in Android uses WebKit as the layout engine. Yet they
								have differences, as the Android's JavaScript engine, which is highly
								relevant for Vaadin, is the Google Chrome's V8 engine. As of TouchKit 4,
								Internet Explorer on Windows Phone is also supported.
            </para>

            <para>
                For the list of devices supported by the latest TouchKit version, see the

            </para>

            <para>
                Vaadin TouchKit aims to follow the quickly evolving APIs of these major
                platforms, with the assumption that other browsers will follow their lead
                in standardization. Other platforms will be supported if they rise in
                popularity.

            <section xml:id="mobile.considerations.compatibility.backbutton">

                <para>
                    Some mobile devices, especially Android and Windows Phone devices,
										have a dedicated back button, while iOS devices in particular do not.
										TouchKit does not provide any particular support for the button, but
										as it is a regular browser back button, you can handle it with URI
										fragments<phrase condition="web">, as described in <xref linkend=

										hidden if the user adds the application to the home screen, in
										which case you need to implement application-specific logic

            At minimum, a TouchKit application requires a UI class, which is defined in a
            deployment descriptor, as usual for Vaadin applications. You usually define a
            servlet class, where you can also do some TouchKit-specific configuration. You
            may also need to have a custom theme. These and other tasks are described in

            <para>
                When using a Servlet 3.0 compatible application server, you usually define
                the UI and make basic configuration with a servlet class with the
                <literal>@WebServlet</literal> annotation. Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse
                creates the servlet class as a static inner class of the UI class, while
                the Maven archetype creates it as a separate class, which is usually the
                preferred way.
            </para>

            <para>
                The servlet class must define the UI class as usual. Additionally, you can

                <para>
                    Using plain CSS is often the easiest way to define a simple theme for
                    a mobile application, as using Sass would not yield all the same
                    benefits as in a regular Vaadin application. TouchKit includes its own
                    base theme in its widget set, so you do not need to
                    <literal>@import</literal> it explicitly.

                    importing the base does not need to (and should not) be done, it could

                    and then compiling it to CSS with the Vaadin theme compiler. However,
                    as above, you should not include a base theme. The rules do not need
                    to be wrapped in a selector with the theme name, as is recommended for
                    regular Vaadin themes.

                    changing the screen orientation. With the add-on, changing the UI
                    layout according to screen orientation is handled entirely on the

                    For example, the CSS for the <guilabel>Stats</guilabel> tab in the
                    demo defines a responsive selector as follows, to allow fitting two
                    charts side-by-side if there is enough room horizontally:

                <para>
                    Normally, if there's 800 pixels or less space horizontally, each chart
                    takes 100% of the screen width, causing the second one to wrap to the
                    next line in the containing <classname>CssLayout</classname>. If there
                    is more space, the two charts are shown in 48% width, so that both can

                <para>
                    Using a GWT theme instead of a regular Vaadin theme offers several
                    performance benefits on mobile devices by reducing the number of
                    resources loaded separately. All the resources, such as images and
                    stylesheets, can be loaded with the widget set. Images can be handled
                    as sprites tiled in bundle images.

                <para>
                    The GWT CSS classes have their own special format, a bit similar to
                    Sass themes. See <link

                    To use a GWT client bundle in a TouchKit application, you need to
                    define a <emphasis>theme loader</emphasis> that extends the TouchKit
                    <classname>ThemeLoader</classname> and implements the
                    <methodname>load()</methodname> method to inject the bundle. The theme
                    loader and the client bundle are a client-side classes that are
                    compiled into the widget set, and must therefore be defined under the
                    <filename>client</filename> directory.

                <para>

                    it. In such case, your GWT theme should import the Vaadin base theme
                    explicitly.

                The <classname>NavigationView</classname> is a layout component that consists
                of a navigation bar and a content area. The content area is scrollable, so
                there is no need to use an inner panel component. In addition, there can be an
                optional toolbar component at the bottom of the
                view. A <classname>NavigationView</classname> is often used inside a
                <classname>NavigationManager</classname> to get view change animations.

                The navigation manager is important for responsiveness, because the previous and

                    Switching between the views (components) is normally done with
                    predefined navigation targets to enhance responsiveness. Clicking a
                    <classname>NavigationButton</classname> or a button in a navigation
                    bar starts navigation automatically without a server roundtrip. Swipe

                <para>
                    Navigation can also be done programmatically with the

                    enabled, the current view is also pushed to the breadcrumb stack. To
                    navigate back, you can call <methodname>navigateBack()</methodname>,
                    which is also called implicitly if a <guibutton>Back</guibutton>
                    button is clicked in a <classname>NavigationView</classname>. Also, if
                    navigation is done to the "previous" component,

                    becomes visible, the <methodname>onBecomingVisible()</methodname> method
                    in the view is called. You can override it, just remember to call the

                You may need to use the same URL and hence the same servlet for both the

                recognize the mobile browsers compatible with Vaadin TouchKit and provide
                a fallback UI for any other browsers. The fallback UI can be a regular
                Vaadin UI, a "Sorry!" message, or a redirection to an alternate user
                interface.

                You can handle the fallback logic in a custom
                <classname>UIProvider</classname> that creates the UIs in the servlet. As
                TouchKit supports only WebKit-based browsers, you can do the recognition
                by checking if the <parameter>user-agent</parameter> string contains the
                sub-string "<literal>webkit</literal>" as follows:

                The geolocation feature in TouchKit allows receiving the geographical
                location from the mobile device. The browser will ask the user to confirm
                that the web site is allowed to get the location information. Tapping
                <guibutton>Share Location</guibutton> gives the permission. The browser
                will give the position acquired by GPS, cellular positioning, or Wi-Fi
                positioning, as enabled in the device.
            </para>

            <para>
                Geolocation is requested by calling the static
                <classname>Geolocator</classname><methodname>.detect()</methodname> method. You
                need to provide a <classname>PositionCallback</classname> handler that
                is called when the device has an answer for your request. If the geolocation
                request succeeded, <methodname>onSuccess()</methodname> is called. Otherwise, e.g
                . if the user didn't allow sharing of his location, <methodname>
                onFailure</methodname> is called. The geolocation data is provided in a

                Greenwich, following the convention for coordinate systems. The accuracy

            <para>
                The <methodname>onFailure()</methodname> is called if the positioning
                fails for some reason. The <parameter>errorCode</parameter> explains the
                reason. Error 1 is returned if the permission was denied, 2 if the
                position is unavailable, 3 on positioning timeout, and 0 on an unknown
                error.

            <para>
                Notice that geolocation can take significant time, depending on the
                location method used by the device. With Wi-Fi and cellular positioning,
                the time is usually less than 30 seconds. With GPS, it can reach minutes
                or longer, especially if the reception is bad. However, once a location fix
                has been made, updates to the location will be faster. If you are making
                navigation software, you need to update the position data fairly frequently by
                calling <classname>Geolocator</classname><methodname>.detect()</methodname>
                multiple times.

                <para>
                    When making a client-side widget that handles file upload, such as for

                    component</link>. In such case, you need to communicate the image data
                    to the server with an RPC call.
                </para>

                <para>
                    On a mobile device, the perhaps most common upload task is to capture
                    images with the integrated camera. To display them in the client-side
                    UI correctly, you want make sure that they have reasonable size and
                    correct orientation, without making a server round-trip to do the
                    corrections. To send them to the server, you want to avoid using too
                    much bandwidth. The <classname>ImageUpload</classname> widget included

                    in the device and capturing an image. It further allows defining an
                    image manipulation pipeline with transformations to reduce the image
                    size if necessary, correct the orientation according to EXIF data, and
                    so forth. The corrected image is loaded to a memory buffer, which
                    you can display in another widget, send to the server, or store in the
                    local store.

        <title>Building an Optimized Widget Set</title>

        <para>
            Mobile networks are generally somewhat slower than DSL Internet
            connections. When starting a Vaadin application, the widget set is the biggest
            resource that needs to be loaded in the browser. As most of the Vaadin
            components are not used by most applications, especially mobile ones, it is
            beneficial to create an optimized version of the widget set.
        </para>

        <para>
            Vaadin supports lazy loading of individual widget implementations when they
            are needed. The <classname>TouchKitWidgetSet</classname> used in TouchKit
            applications optimizes the widgetset to only download the most essential
            widgets first and then load other widget implementation lazily. This is a good
            compromise for most TouchKit applications. Nevertheless, because of the high
            latency of most mobile networks, loading the widget set in small pieces might
            not be the best solution for every case. With custom optimization, you can
            create a monolithic widget set stripped off all unnecessary widgets. Together
            with proper GZip compression, is should be quite light-weight for mobile
            browsers.
        </para>

        <para>
            However, if the application has big components which are rarely used or
            not on the initial views, it may be best to load those widgets eagerly or
            lazily.
        </para>

            You can find a working example of widget set optimization in the

            <filename>WidgetMapGenerator.java</filename> in the Vornitologist sources.

            <title>Generating the Widget Map</title>

            <para>
                You can fine-tune a widget set by using a custom
                <classname>WidgetMapGenerator</classname> implementation. The generator
                class should extend <classname>TouchKitBundleLoaderFactory</classname> and
                override its <methodname>getConnectorsForWidgetset()</methodname>
                method. The method returns the connector classes of the widgets used in
                the widget set.
            </para>

            <para>
                The list of used connectors (and their widgets) can be built manually
                if you know what components you use in your application. You can also,
                for example, use a debugger to dig into the
                <classname>CommunicationManager</classname> class in Vaadin, which
                opens all the views of the running application. It contains a set of
                all components that have been used so far.
            </para>

            <para>
                In Vornitologist, we first build a list of the connector class names in
                the constructor as follows:
            </para>

            <programlisting><?pocket-size 65% ?><![CDATA[public class WidgetLoaderFactory

            <para>
                Then we use the list it in the
                <methodname>getConnectorsForWidgetset()</methodname> to create the proper
                list of class type definitions by filtering them from all class type
                definitions. <classname>JClassType</classname> is used for type
                definition.

                Note that you need to enable GZip compression for your deployment if you
                wish to optimize the startup time and minimize the amount of transferred
                data. The best method for doing that highly depends on your hosting setup,
                so we do not cover it here.

            Testing places special challenges for mobile devices. The mobile browsers may not
            have much debugging features and you may not be able to install third-party
            debugging add-ons, such as the Chrome Developer Tools.
        </para>

                The debug window, as described in <xref
                linkend="advanced.debug"/>, works on mobile browsers as
                well, even if it is a bit harder to use.

            <para>
                The lack of in-browser analysis tools can be helped with simple
                client-side coding. For example, you can dump the HTML content of the page
                with the <parameter>innerHTML</parameter> property in the HTML DOM. To do
                so, you need to execute a JavaScript call from the server-side and handle
                its response with a call-back method, as described in <xref
                linkend="advanced.javascript.callback"/>.

                    TouchKit supports especially WebKit-based browsers, which are used in
                    iOS and Android devices. You can therefore reach a decent
                    compatibility by using a desktop browser based on WebKit, such as
                    Google Chrome. Features such as geolocation are also supported by
                    desktop browsers. If you make your phone/tablet-detection and
                    orientation detection using screen size, you can easily emulate the
                    modes by resizing the browser. Also, the browsers have special
                    development settings to emulate some features in touch devices.
